### Daehwa Kim
 
Hi, I am a research associate at [Future Interfaces Group](http://figlab.com/), Carnegie Mellon University. :fire: Formerly, I completed my Masters at [KAIST HCI Lab](https://hcil.kaist.ac.kr/). My research goal is to enrich the expressiveness and degrees of freedom of interfaces so that they create new and pleasant experiences for users. My research interests lie in sensing technologies, sensor fabrication, and AR/VR/MR interfaces.

I presented several projects at ACM CHI and UIST and have received an Honorable Mention award at CHI 2021. Please visit [my website](https://daehwa.github.io/) and take a look!
