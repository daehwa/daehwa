### Daehwa Kim
 
Hi, I am a 3rd-year PhD student at [Future Interfaces Group](http://figlab.com/) in Carnegie Mellon University. :fire: Formerly, I interned at Apple AIML Robotics (2025, 2024), and Meta Reality Labs (2023). I also completed my Masters at [KAIST HCI Lab](https://hcil.kaist.ac.kr/). My research explores the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Sensing, and Machine Learning.

I have presented several projects at ACM CHI and UIST and received two Best Paper nominations at CHI. Please visit [my website](https://daehwa.github.io/) and take a look!
